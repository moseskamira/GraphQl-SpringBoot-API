# GraphQl-SpringBoot-API
This Project is intended to implement GraphQl in Spring Boot using Java.

### Used Technologies
- Spring Boot.
- Java as a Programming Language. 
- GraphQL.
- Maven
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL Driver

### Why Use GraphQL Over REST API
- GraphQL allows the use of only a single end point unlike REST
- With GraphQL only desired data can be fetched from an object unlike REST that returns all data about an object.
